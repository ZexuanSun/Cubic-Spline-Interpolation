# Codes

These are the codes that we used for the project. You can use the codes to replicate 
the numerical experiments we carried out and the figures in the report. We mainly employed 
the function **csape** to help us.

### Notes

**slopes.m**: implement clamped cubic spline interpolant and 
draw figures.

**slope_error.m**: calculate the error of clamped cubic spline interpolant 
and draw figures.

**second.m**: implement cubic spline interpolant when matching the 2nd derivative at ends  and 
draw figures.

**second_error.m**: calculate the error of cubic spline interpolant when matching the 2nd derivative at ends 
and 
draw figures.

**periodic.m**: implement periodic cubic spline interpolant  and draw figures.

**periodic_error.m**:
calculate the error of periodic cubic spline interpolant
and 
draw figures.

**error_of_clamped_and_second.m**:
compare the error of clamped cubic spline interpolant and cubic spline interpolant when matching the 2nd derivative at ends
and 
draw figures.

**disturbance.m**:
calculate errors in interpolation with three end conditions before and after perturbation and draw figures.
